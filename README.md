Liverpool host Everton in the Merseyside derby in the Premier League on Sunday as the hosts look to boost their chances of taking the title.

They are two points behind Manchester City and will have to continue their winning run if they hope to chase down the defending champions. If they do, they could be on for the quadruple. The Reds have already won the Carabao Cup, they are in the FA Cup final and will compete in the Champions League semi-finals.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said he is surprised at where the club find themselves. “It’s a situation we didn’t expect to be in,” he said.

“We love being in this situation. It’s incredibly tough - we play pretty much all the time. You cannot plan that you are still in everything. But we know there’s nothing we have achieved so far, or not a lot. We won one competition, that’s great, but there are three others to go.
